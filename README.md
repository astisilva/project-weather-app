# Weather App

A weather app to show weather information and a 7-day forecast.

## The problem

- Creating this weather app was quite a challenge! At the start, I focused on learning how to get and show data properly. I split the big project into smaller tasks to make things easier.

- One tough part was dealing with dates and times, especially showing days and hours correctly. To figure this out, I asked ChatGPT for help and searched online to understand how dates and times work in JavaScript.

- I used JavaScript and the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.

- Testing and making small changes step by step were key during development. This kept problems away and made things go smoothly.
  And comments to keep focus what I was doing. ChatGPT and Google were like superhero sidekicks, helping me solve tricky issues.

- If I had more time, I would do the stretch goals.

- making this app taught me a lot. It challenged me to solve problems and showed me how to mix real-world data into a friendly app.
